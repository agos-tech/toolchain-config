# Toolchain configurations

## Usage

This repository hosts toolchain configurations as defined with
[`nitpick`](https://nitpick.readthedocs.io) styles.

The [`nitpick` directory](nitpick) contains the style definitions to enforce a
consistent toolchain configuration across our repositories.

**Important note:** The project is moving from project-local toolchains to
container-based toolchains. A living example can be observed here with
`make lint`.

### Python projects

Bootstrap `nitpick` by:

1. Updating the pre-commit configuration with:

   ```
   # .pre-commit-config.yaml
   repos:
     ...
     - repo: https://github.com/andreoliwa/nitpick
       rev: v0.21.2
       hooks:
         - id: nitpick
   ```

2. Updating the Python project configuration with:

   ```
   # pyproject.toml
   ...

   [tool.nitpick]
   style = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/agos-tech/toolchain-config/<COMMIT_REF>/nitpick/python-style.toml"
   ```

   Where `<COMMIT_REF>` points to a commit reference.

3. Kick-starting `nitpick` which will now control the toolchain configuration:

   ```
   % poetry run pre-commit run nitpick
   ```

4. Configure the semantic release in `package.json`, take inspiration from this
   very repository's [configuration](package.json). In particular, the version
   bump needs to be adapted to target the specific file hosting defining the
   value.

### Other projects

`nitpick` is (currently) biased towards Python projects. For non-Python projects
(like this one), we need to cheat our way in:

1. Create `setup.cfg` in the root directory, either specifying the directories
   to `include` or the ones to `exclude` (comma-separated values):

   ```
   # setup.cfg
   [flake8]
   include = "nitpick"
   ```

2. Create an empty dummy Python file to force the linter to run in your target
   directory.

3. Configure the semantic release in `package.json`, take inspiration from this
   very repository's [configuration](package.json).

## Development

This project applies the general styles it defines with a pre-commit hook. You
will need the following software to develop against it:

- Python 3.7

Set-up the development environment with:

```
% python3 -mvenv .venv
% . ./.venv/bin/activate
(.venv) % pip install -r build-requirements.txt
(.venv) % pre-commit install
```

## Next steps

The next iteration of this project is all about containerising the toolchains
per language / environment instead of having each project instantiating their
own toolchain.

The Continuous Integration templates (see below) already feature this change.
This updated behaviour reduces the toolchain complexity, especially when
instantiating it â€” whether from scratch or from cache. The only moving part left
is the container image, making the pipeline more resilient to external breakage.

## Continuous Integration

Additional validation is run during continuous integration, see the
[Azure Pipelines configuration](azure-pipelines.yml).

The extra Node.js dependencies (frozen with `yarn`) are only used by the build
pipeline, there is no need to install them locally.

### Releases

The Azure pipeline will create a new release every time `master` is updated. The
release commit will be signed, and a new tag will be pushed.

The private key and passphrase must be made available to the pipeline,
respectively through
[Secure Files](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/library/secure-files)
and
[Pipeline Secrets](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/process/variables#secret-variables).

### Syncing with the GitHub mirror

After creating a new release, the pipeline will synchronise the `master` branch
as well as the tags with the
[public GitHub mirror](https://github.com/agos-tech/toolchain-config).

Similarly to the cryptographic signature, this step requires a Pipeline Secret
that holds the GitHub Personal Access Token.
