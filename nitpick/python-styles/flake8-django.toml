# http://www.pydocstyle.org/en/3.0.0/error_codes.html
# Ignore C408: Sometimes readability trumps efficiency, and so we don't mandate dict
#   literals.
# Ignore D10: FIXME: Cowardly drop all docstring-related errors (D10*).
# Ignore D105: If a magic method needs a docstring its behaviour is probably unpythonic.
# Ignore D107: An __init__ that needs no docstring is a good thing.
# Ignore D202: pydocstyle triggers a false positive with inner functions defined after a
#   docstring, let Black handle this edge case.
# Ignore DJ08: Custom __str__ methods in db models make it easy to reference model
#   fields that can trigger additional db queries upon evaluation, which might happen
#   in the admin panel or a logging call. Best to avoid this altogether.
# Ignore DJ10: We don't really use the Django models names, no need for their
#   `verbose_name`s.
# Ignore DJ11: Same reasoning as with DJ10 for `verbose_name_plural`
# Ignore DJ12: FIXME #2850: Cravenly accept our models are not consistently ordered.
# Ignore E203: black inserts a space before : in a slice, flake8 complains about it.
# Ignore E731: It is sometimes "better" to have named inline lambdas than full
#    functions.
# Ignore G100: We do not maintain a logging argument whitelist.
# Ignore RST304: The reST roles should not be validated by flake8.
# Ignore W503: Line breaks should be before binary operators, not after.
